##  Topics & Advance Readings

In advance of the design workshop, all participants produced a one-or-two page topic paper to be shared with the other attendees on either:

* A specific problem that they wanted to solve with a web-of-trust solution, and why current solutions (PGP or CA-based PKI) can't address the problem?
* A specific solution related to the web-of-trust that you'd like others to use or contribute to?

* The 8000 word conversation on twitter about whether [putting Hashed PII on the blockchain is a good idea or not](https://identitywoman.net/putting-hashed-pii-immutable-ledgerblockchain-bad-idea/). Sparked and Documented by [Kaliya "identity woman" Young](http://www.identitywoman.net)
